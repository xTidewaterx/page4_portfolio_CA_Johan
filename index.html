            <p class="a">grid template, using grid areas we can in a graphic way show and understand how our layout willl be, and the content inside of the grid template will be assigned the available space in the grid-template's parent container, all the childs are assigned a grid area that matches the area names mentioned in the parent container, then the childs will be assigned with the avilable room in accordance to how many times their names we're rpeated in the grid template. All of this helps us create well functioning layouts that dont overlap and interfere with each other because of different margins and paddings, we manage to create a layout that is all defined in a single container with the grid template, only with the addition of some name given to the childs. We create very efficient code that ensure our pages accessibility. The grid template gives our page a safe way to create heaps of different layouts without the risk of having different content interere with each other by accident. Having all of our container refer abck to the same parent container gives us less code, creating effeicency and ensuring a rliable site as the content has fewer possibility of error and requires less maintenance since it can all be sourced back tto a known source rather than speculating in all the individualities linked to an array of different information trying to coexist. We create order, we create a fundament that ensures reliability and less code gives us both efficiency and returns the same result.  Adaptability is important, the grid assigns all it's childs the avilable area in the specified container, creating for great acessbility and clarity as the content will be optimised in accordance to any viewport it is interfering with. We code for efficiency and use the same fundament for many element, giving us reliable and secure code.

We us the WCAG/Web Content Accessibility guidelines to ensure our page is perceivable, active, and understandable

WCGAV ACCSESSBILITY, contrast ratio: when creating a website we need to ensure that the information on our webpage is understandable and accessible by a wide variety of users. 
This includes people with poor reading comprehension, lack of color deficiencies. Color can often be tricky for people so a contrast is a better indicator as it sheds different amount of lights, creating the unavodiable, dark vs light  differantiation, which creates a much more solid way of differentiating text from background. We also have a lower contrast ratio criteria for larger text as wider chartacter strokes creates for better readabilty and thus the requirements are all relative to the text in question and certain charcteristics of the text can lower the general criteria for the remaining criteria as we are trying to meet a sum of readabilty rather than needlessly check boxes when that original crriteria sum is met collectively already. OInce a  certain degree of readability is met in accordance with the Web Content accessibility guidelines .




Image alt attribute with the <img> element :we use the alt text for our image, not because HTML demands it but because it is incredibly useful for accsessibility, and screen readers will use that information for their users who want somebody to read them what the image means, alt text is also displayed if there is any issues loading the image,  which could happen because of a variety of reasons like content blocking, network error etc.. So to improve accessibilyt and allow a different way of percieving our pagfes chosen image we add the alt attribute text that holds a descirption of our image. We use all of this knowledge combined with the knowledge that visible light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is percieved by the human eye, and when creating different contrast we know that one of them carries more light as darkness is the abssence of light. When nearly all light is reflected we see white, the electromagnetic radtion is livid, when no ligth is reflected we see black. ANd our users then recivve and measure the amount of incoming light in their retina mediated by their photoreceptors, thus indulging all recieved light into the automated process wired to the human brain,  creating for the entire experience of our webpage visually. </p>

                <p class="b"> For my science museum website it was important that all people would be catered to, and that readability was optimised as science helps all people and attracts a large target audience. 

I choose to give change the proportions of some of my div boxes to help translate the museum and science specific information on the page better. On this page I also added titles to some of the divs to help the search engine acknowledge the exact type of content the museum site provided. The content of a page title can have significant implications for search engine optimization, I created a longer, more descriptive title to help the search engine recognise the scenario depicted in the image and offered through our museum, this would help the engine algorithms to display our page in the search results of a user looking for something that matches our museums offering.

 Throughout the entire page I wanted to create a page that was more responsive and more accessible, apart from some of the bright colours I also wanted to convey the elegancy and importance of technology by adding a earthly, conservative tone behind the front page text boxes. 

This helps with readability and creates a site that feels dependable and flexible, our museum must feel both intriguing, welcoming and relaxing to reach our target audience that wants to spend their holidays at the museum,  peeking their curiosity through our technology while simultaneously enjoying their stay in a relaxing fashion. This is mastered through our vibrant colours combined with our earthly beige tones, and with our increase in accessibility and adaptiveness we have a page that caters to a large amount of users, as well as a page that  is more likely to be suggested to in the search engine results because of our descriptive tags and use of descriptive h tags in the correct order and with the correct use of spacing to allow our text hierarchy to establish an understandable page for our users as well as the SEO that becomes more aware of the exact information our page outputs to the internet. 
                    
                    an example of text hierarchy is using the h1 for tthe title of the story, the h2 elements for the titlte of each chapter and then we can use the h3 for a sub-section of those chapters. So with this webpage, to keep it orderly we have used the text hierarchy both to calrify the difference in importance between the elements for the user who reads the text inbetween the text we've put inbetween the tags, but we also do this for the seo of the website
we do all of this for potential visitors haveing the best chance at finding our page. Most ebsites depend on organic search engine traffic, as advertising and such is usually short-lived unless you have an unlimited amount of money to spend.  By utilisnig the added descriptive fields in the html we endulge in the process of improving our website so that it achieves a higher ranking in something called "search engine SERPS". These SRP's  gives us a better chance at reciving clicks from search engine users who can then see our website listed in the search engine results. </p>

            <div class="card-c"><a href="https://fervent-hawking-afaff1.netlify.app/"><h2>Web Page 3</h2></a>

            <p class="c"> I wanted to create a page that was closer to the WCGA  than the previous iteration. These guidelines create a understanding for what is needed to have an accessible page. For me a lot of my accessibility problems were among other things due to using length units like vw for the card fonts. This resulted in a font that on small viewports would be far to small and thus hinder certain people from reading the text, now I decided to use another unit to decide the size of the text, I would use EM.  For the p tag I decided on using the length unit EM.  For accessibility you sometimes want ot avoid using absolute units as they in cases like here do not scale. PX do not scale as EM does. 

Therefore I wanted to use relative units, such as em. EM and relative units are good because absolute units are often optimal for physical prints as a print always measures 1cm to be 1cm, whereas our perception of size on a screen depends largely on what distance we operate the screen from, a desktop monitor will often make one centimetre appear small whereas that same centimetre on a handheld device right in front of your eyes can be quite significant.

 Therefore it is better for us to use relative units that can better adapt to these variations we find in the  conundrum  of the personal technology based world. The em is the font size. With em we can instead of setting the font size of the body element use the default size of the device being operated, because then we have the value that is decided to be optimal for the user instead of something relative to something quite unrelated.  Getting input directly from the users system is usually optimal as that is crafted with care and knowledge that focuses on the individual case study each time. Font size is great for using em. We also like to use em when setting margins as they are relative to the settings of the default size belonging to the current device implemented. Having the correct font size displayed relative to the multitude of different devices as well as creating a good contrast ratio for all the headings and paragraphs creates a  webpage that is accessible for the most amount of people. Readability is crucial when developing a webpage. To further improve the accessibility on our page we ensured the images had alt texts, the alt text can help users who have a difficulty digesting the images, and the alt texts will display instead of the image if there is a technical issue with displaying the image, adding an alt text to the images is a part of the important dedication to creating webpages that offer understandable information, for everybody. 


I improved the responsiveness of the about page by removing the negative margin when the screen is less than 550px tall, now the text avoids overlapping with the nav, the p tag stays outside of the nav area. For this I used a media query with max-height 550px. We have regained parts of the space that translate to our text hierarchy and offers the reader a better understanding of the importance of our different lines of text. .The landing page was refurbished using a more uniform system in regards to the sizing of content, I used the same relative lenght units instead of many different length units, length unit width auto: I have now let the carouselContainer adapt to the columns using width auto, this auto unit adapts to the column gap, in stark contrast to vw which was used prior. Now the content immediately expands to accomdodate the columns of inofrmation which has great readability due to the consistent sising and good relationsship between the parents and children that now accomodate each other, with the black font we have the contrast ratio we want. 

mobile carousell:: now i have made the cards avoid inline block, they now are blocks and  the same margin applied to all of them, they are now put in the same relative postion to their parents, img, removed the margin on image, so it now takes the img styling of margin 0 auto combined with display flex. 

change the negative marign issues on ipad 
use correct length units

cardcolour-i changed the cardcolour to create great readbility, i gave it a light tone to differeantiate the card from the white backgroiund, then i used the classic black for the font inside the card, also, to keep the text from feeling claustrophobic and to make the text clearly remain withtin it's text hierachy which is the cards borders, i added extra text margin for the text to lie comfortaably iwthin the card and closer ot the center of it's parent ot show the correlation better. 

responsive page-changed the blogsPosts.html page, making the adaptability/responsiveness better, now the  >500px heights don't experience the content overflowing and overlapping so that the layout remains intact and all structures are individually sorted still, we have made the layout shrink successful. </p>
